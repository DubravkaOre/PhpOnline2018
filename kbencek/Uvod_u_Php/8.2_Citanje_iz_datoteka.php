//Koraci:
// 1. pripremi $handle sa fopen()
// 2. prebaci sadrzaj u citljiv oblik -> string fread ()
// ispisi sa echo

// 'polaznici.txt'; -->direktan pristup u istom direktoriju
// ./polaznici.txt'; --> relativna putanja od trenutnog direktorija
// '/kbencek/polaznici.txtÂ´ --> apsolutna putanja 


$filename = "polaznici.php"; //najispravnije rjesenje 
$mode = 'r';
$handle= fopen($filename, $mode); // handle je tipa resource

$contents= fread($handle, filesize($filename));
fclose($handle);

echo $contents;
